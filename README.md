## Materials
- I found some nice fabric cut offs at spotlight (blue stripes) and after using it as a table cloth for 6 months it started to fray and I thought making something wearable out of it could be fun!
- The yellow flowery trim was a long shirt i found at a sale of old stock from first scene, the shirt had some holes in it but the fabric was beautiful so i thought i had to find some way to use it
- Elastic (bought from spotlight, need to find second hand elastic supply in the future)
